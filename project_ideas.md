## Meta Learning

[Few Shot Learning for Lesion Classification](http://cs330.stanford.edu/fall2020/projects2020/CS330_Surya_Narayanan_Oussama_Fadil_Sandra_Ha.pdf)
* dataset are huge 
* no github code
* archiecture use LSTM, we could use multi attentions head such as bert, GPT3 ???
* uses ResNet50 instead of MobileNet-V2 model
* grid search could be improved with evolution strategies ???
